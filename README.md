Automatic classification of a person's personality based on a piece of text written by that person is an inherently difficult task, but its difficulty could increase depending on the dataset used. In this work, we explore the classification performance of many different machine learning models with various feature combinations when the dataset consists of stream-of-consciousness essays written by students. Despite achieving very good performance, we argue that such a dataset may not be ideal for personality trait classification.
